This is a repository of several Gtk# example programs that I discovered while poking around on my laptop.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  I did not write these.  They were written by others.  Where I have been able to find an author, I tried to keep that with the program.

As found, most of these would not run as they were in a form not recognized by my Linux .NET Core 3.1 version of C#.  

What I have done is modified each one so that it would actually work and produce it's correct output.  These are not useable programs in most cases.

NOTE: Though I have tried to correct what I can to bring it up to current standards (as I know them), there are still a few problems.  Mostly, this relates to obsolete class/method calls.

As far as I know right now, even though obsolete and deprecated, the calls will still run.  I've tested each one that I've completed so far.

Additionally, while I got them running, I don't know if they run correctly, or what they are supposed to show.  I'll have to study them more after I finish. Or, you can.

The work is not yet finished, but I hope to finish it soon.

The last one I've completed is: Main


WARNING: These were set up to run on a Linux PC, using .NET Core 3.1, and Nuget package GtkSharp.
Nothing is guaranteed to work on any specific machine.  Check to make sure the .vscode folder matches and that the project file is correct.
GtkSharp is installed globally on my PC, so only the correct dependency is needed in the project file.
